## Introduction
This project is based on the Cortana Intelligence Gallery Competition . This competition was part of the requirement for Data Science Professional Project for **Microsoft Professional Program in Data Science(MPP-DS)**. The competition started on 12/12/2016 and ended on 1/29/2017. The evaluation criterium to achieve a passing grade in the accompanying course is that **Private Score Highest** has to be at least **70%**. 

### Short Description for the Required Task 
This competition concerns loan data. When a customer applies for a loan, banks and other credit providers use statistical models to determine whether or not to grant the loan based on the likelihood of the loan being repaid. The factors involved in determining this likelihood are complex, and extensive statistical analysis and modelling are required to predict the outcome for each individual case. You must implement a model that predicts loan repayment or default based on the data provided.
